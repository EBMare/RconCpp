# RconCpp

I coded this simple RCON API for c++. It uses boost asio so you can run it on UNIX and windows systems

## Use

Create a new folder inside the Project directory.
Name it "lib".

download boost from https://www.boost.org/users/download/.
The library is a header-only library. This means that you do not have to build it.

After the download is done, copy out the boost folder and put it into the newly created "lib" folder
