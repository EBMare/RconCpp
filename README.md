# RconCpp

I coded this simple RCON API for c++. It uses boost asio so you can run it on UNIX and windows systems

## Build your own project on this

Create a new folder inside the Project directory.
Name it "lib".

download boost from https://www.boost.org/users/download/.
The library is a header-only library. This means that you do not have to build it.

After the download is done, copy out the boost folder and put it into the newly created "lib" folder

Know you can open the .sln file and start using this project for future work
